/**
 * Regenerate the browser-parity EXPECTED fixture.
 *
 * Runs the engine in NODE (real `node:zlib`) over the sample file-map and writes
 * the resulting AuditReport — exactly what `runAudit` produces (same vigilesVersion
 * + the meta.dir slug override). The browser-parity test then computes the SAME
 * report in-browser via pako and asserts deep equality: if pako's gzip length ever
 * diverged from node's, the NCD-driven description-overlap grade would differ and
 * this test would fail. Run:  node site/scripts/gen-parity-expected.mjs
