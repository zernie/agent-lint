/**
 * `local/experimental-name` — a symbol the source calls EXPERIMENTAL must SAY SO
 * IN ITS NAME.
 *
 * One sentence: if an exported declaration carries the `@experimental` TSDoc tag,
 * its name must start with `experimental_`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, measured. The prefix convention already existed —
 * `experimental_emitTool`, `experimental_parseEmitted`, `experimental_withServices`
 * were all named that way on purpose. It was written down nowhere and enforced by
 * nothing, so `skill()` shipped from `vigiles/spec` under a stable name while
 * `docs/skills.md` opened with "**`skill()` is experimental**". Prose said one
 * thing, the API said the other — the exact defect class vigiles exists to catch,
 * in vigiles. A convention that is only a habit gets violated by the next author,
 * and the reader who trusts the NAME (the thing an editor autocompletes) never
 * reads the doc that would have warned them.
 *
 * WHAT IT SUBTRACTS: the ability to mark something experimental in one place and
 * stable in another. Experimentality is declared ONCE, in TSDoc, and the name is
 * checked against it.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY AN ESLINT RULE AND NOT THE SCRIPT IT REPLACES
 *
 * This began as `scripts/check-experimental-naming.mjs`, a standalone pass over
 * regex-matched declaration lines, gated by `npm run experimental:check`. Two
 * things were wrong with that shape and only one of them was obvious.
 *
 * The obvious one: it hand-rolled a parser. `VALUE_DECL` was a regex against a
 * single line, so it could not see a declaration whose modifiers wrapped, and
 * `tagRe` walked backwards through lines guessing where the doc comment started.
 * ESLint hands us the AST and the attached comments. Same class as this repo's
 * own rule about parsing markdown with a parser instead of regexes: a hand-rolled
 * matcher over structured input is a deferred defect, and this one had already
 * shipped two — a tag with prose after it was invisible for a while (2 of 8
 * `@experimental` declarations and 31 of 39 `@internal` ones), and a bare opt-out
 * marker read as an explained one.
 *
 * The less obvious one, and the reason the port was blocked until now: the script
 * needed `api-surface/*.api.md` to decide what was PUBLIC, because internal
 * symbols were exempt. That exemption is what made it cross-file — and it also
 * contradicted the script's own stated rationale, that "the reader who trusts the
 * NAME never opens the doc". An internal reader is a reader. Dropping the
 * exemption removes the api reports from the equation entirely, and what is left
 * is jsdoc + name, both of which live in one file.
 *
 * 🔴 That drop was only SAFE after a separate change, and the order matters. The
 * six compiled-hook entry points used to be declared unprefixed and gain the
 * prefix at their re-export in `src/hook.ts` — so at the declaration site, 14
 * tagged symbols looked like violations, and a per-file rule would have opened at
 * 14 false findings and been switched off within the day. The de-aliasing landed
 * first (one spelling per symbol, everywhere). Re-measured after it, on the whole
 * of `src/`, with no exemption at all: **22 tagged exported value declarations,
 * 0 without the prefix.** The rule turns on silent.
 *
 * THE THREE EXPORT PATHS, all covered — because a rule that policed one of them
 * while claiming to police exports would be worse than one honest about a narrow
 * scope: the overstatement is what stops anyone looking. Each was a separate hole
 * and each was found by a reviewer, not by me:
 *   1. `export const x` / `export function x`  — the declaration form;
 *   2. `export { x }` / `export { experimental_x as x }` — specifiers, including a
 *      tagged local declared separately (judged at `Program:exit`, since the export
 *      may legally precede the declaration);
 *   3. `export default function x() {}` — visited by a different node type entirely.
 *
 * ⚠️ The one case it cannot cover: an ANONYMOUS default (`export default () => {}`)
 * has no name to carry a marker. That is a limit of a name-based convention, not a
 * gap in this rule, and it is stated rather than left as unexplained silence.
 *
 * SCOPE: value declarations only (`function` / `const` / `let` / `var` / `class`).
 * Types and interfaces are out, deliberately and by measurement: the convention
 * only ever applied to callables, and the surface before the gate paired
 * `experimental_startServices` with a plain `ServiceSpec`, `ServiceHandle`,
 * `ContainerRuntime`. Pulling types in would have opened with 6 cosmetic renames
 * against 1 real finding, and a gate that arrives 86% noise is muted the same day.
 *
 * A `@module` tag documents the FILE, not one symbol — a file-level
 * `@module vigiles/eval (services)` must not condemn every export beneath it.
 *
 * OPT OUT on the declaration, with a reason on the SAME line:
 *   `vigiles:experimental-name-ok <why>`
 * The same-line requirement is not fussiness: `\s+\S` is satisfied by a newline
 * plus the JSDoc continuation `*`, so a bare marker followed by any further tag
 * would read as "explained".
