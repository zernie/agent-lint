/**
 * check-docs.mjs — type-check the TypeScript examples in the docs against THIS
 * repo's own build, with two tiers:
 *
 *   GATE 1 (always, every ts block): report ONLY diagnostics about this package's
 *           own module surface — a subpath that is not in the exports map, or a
 *           named import the built package does not export. Free variables,
 *           partial snippets and deliberate type errors are invisible to it, so
 *           an illustrative fragment cannot make it fire.
 *   GATE 2 (opt-in, block marked `<!-- vigiles:check -->`): full tsc diagnostics.
 *
 * 🔴 RECONSIDERED AND REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT, 2026-08-21 — recorded so it is not
 * proposed again. A review round found two doc blocks calling this package's own
 * exports without importing them (`experimental_agent` in railway-subagents.md,
 * `result` in emit-channel.md) — both the residue of a rename that updated the
 * import line and not the body. Gate 1 is blind to them by design, since they are
 * free variables.
 *
 * The tempting narrowing: report TS2304, but ONLY for names this package actually
 * exports. It sounds precise — a fragment referencing a local `planner` stays
 * silent, a fragment calling `result()` with no import does not. It was
 * implemented and run against the corpus before being kept, and the number
 * settled it: **66 findings across 93 blocks.** Docs legitimately name our
 * exports as free variables all over — `skillResolved`, `assertTriggerRate`,
 * `codexAdapter` — in fragments that deliberately omit the import they already
 * showed three blocks earlier. A gate opening at 66 is muted the same day, which
 * is the founding decision above, re-derived the hard way.
 *
 * What was done instead: the two blocks in question are COMPLETE programs, so
 * they now carry `<!-- vigiles:check -->` and get real tsc diagnostics forever.
 * That is Gate 2 used as intended — per-block opt-in where completeness is a
 * property of the block, rather than a corpus-wide rule that cannot be true of a
 * corpus mostly made of fragments.
 *
 * No network. No new CLI verb. Resolution is TypeScript's own package
 * self-reference: `import ... from "vigiles/eval"` resolves through this
 * package.json's `exports` map to the local ./dist.
