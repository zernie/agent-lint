/**
 * Tests for `scripts/check-export-prefixes.mjs` — the gate that holds the two
 * quarantine subpaths (`./eval` → `paid_`, `./experimental` → `experimental_`) to
 * their naming contract.
 *
 * 🔴 EVERY CASE HERE HAS BOTH HALVES: it FIRES on a planted violation AND it is
 * SILENT on the legitimate surface next door. A gate whose success looks like
 * silence cannot be noticed broken, so "silent" alone is indistinguishable from
 * dead — this repository has shipped three checks that were dead on arrival, and
 * every one of them was found by accident rather than by a test.
 *
 * The silent-half cases are the load-bearing ones, and two of them encode real
 * ways this check could pass vacuously:
 *
 *   - TYPES must not be flagged. They are exempt by design (a type cannot be
 *     called, so it cannot bill), and the report types are re-exported from BOTH
 *     barrels — flagging them would demand `paid_` names on the FREE surface.
 *   - ALIASED re-exports must still be seen as values. `./eval` is built entirely
 *     from `export { x as paid_x }`, and an alias reports the Alias flag, not
 *     Value. A version of this check that forgot to resolve aliases would treat
 *     every export on `./eval` as a type and pass on an all-unprefixed barrel.
