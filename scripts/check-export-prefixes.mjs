/**
 * check-export-prefixes.mjs — a subpath that carries a WARNING in its name must
 * carry it on every symbol behind it too.
 *
 * ONE quarantine subpath in this package pairs a path with a name prefix:
 *
 *   ./eval          →  every runtime export starts with `paid_`
 *
 * There were two. `./experimental` was deleted 2026-08-21 on the argument this
 * header already made — that of the pair, only the NAME is present where the
 * reader is — so the `experimental_` prefix now stands alone, enforced per
 * declaration by the ESLint rule `local/experimental-name` rather than per
 * subpath by this script. Nothing was relaxed: the prefix is checked in MORE
 * places than before, since it no longer depends on which door a symbol left by.
 *
 * 🔴 That deletion is also how this check earned its own bug report. Moving R3
 * onto `./eval` looked reasonable and this gate rejected it: `paid_` means "this
 * call can bill you", and `experimental_startServices` takes a
 * `ContainerRuntime` and starts containers — it calls no model. The tempting fix
 * was `paid_experimental_startServices`, which would have quietly redefined
 * `paid_` as "expensive in some sense" and turned the prefix back into
 * decoration. R3 went to the package root instead. A quarantine prefix is only
 * worth having while it is narrow enough to be false somewhere.
 *
 * The reason the prefix exists at all is that the import path warns ONCE, at the
 * top of a file, and the name warns EVERY time, at the call site. Reading
 * `await judged(trace, "did it refuse?")` on line 140, the import line is long
 * out of view; `await paid_judged(...)` still says what it costs.
 *
 * A convention held only by prose decays the moment someone adds one export in a
 * hurry — and it HAD decayed: `makeDockerRuntime` sat unprefixed among six
 * `experimental_` siblings on the old `./experimental` until this check was
 * written. One missing prefix is worse than none at all, because the six that
 * are prefixed teach the reader that an unprefixed name means "safe".
 *
 * TYPES ARE EXEMPT, BY DESIGN, NOT BY OVERSIGHT. The prefix warns about calling
 * something. A type is never called and can never bill or misbehave, so
 * `paid_EvalReport` would be noise on a symbol that cannot do the thing being
 * warned about — and the report types are deliberately re-exported from BOTH
 * `vigiles` and `vigiles/eval`, so prefixing them would make the free barrel
 * carry `paid_` names. This script reads the built `.d.ts` with the TypeScript
 * compiler rather than grepping the source precisely so that it can tell a value
 * from a type instead of guessing.
 *
 * Exit code 1 on any violation — this FAILS, it does not nudge. A quarantine
 * convention that only prints a suggestion is the prose it was meant to replace.
