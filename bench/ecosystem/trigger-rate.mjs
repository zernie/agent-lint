/**
 * Does the caveman skill, installed the REAL way (--plugin-dir), actually FIRE on
 * normal coding prompts? Its description triggers on "caveman mode" / "be brief" /
 * "less tokens" — phrases a normal coding session never says. So the in-the-wild
 * activation rate is the second, cleaner half of the debunk: install it, code
 * normally, and it stays dormant → 0% savings before any compression argument.
 *
 * Uses vigiles's own measureTriggerRate (real model, on the subscription). The
 * `fired` predicate matches any Skill tool call naming caveman (robust to the
 * plugin:skill id). Neutral prompts = real coding asks; the trigger-phrase set is
 * a control showing the skill CAN fire when actually invoked.
 *
 *   node bench/ecosystem/trigger-rate.mjs         # neutral coding (expect ~0)
 *   TRIGGER=1 node bench/ecosystem/trigger-rate.mjs   # explicit "be brief" control
