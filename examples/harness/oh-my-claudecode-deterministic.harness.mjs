/**
 * oh-my-claudecode walkthrough — Tier 2: deterministic harness test
 * (`runHarnessTest`).
 *
 * Right logic (Tier 1) ≠ wired in correctly and reaching the model. This tier
 * runs the REAL `claude` CLI against a SCRIPTED mock model (no API key, same
 * result every time), with OMC's real `keyword-detector` hook wired on
 * `UserPromptSubmit`. It proves two things a "did it run?" check can't:
 *
 *   1. the hook actually FIRED in a real session, and
 *   2. its injected `additionalContext` actually LANDED in the model's request
 *      (`trace.modelRequests`) — "fired ≠ landed".
 *
 * The hook is wired via inline `settings` (code we authored here → trusted →
 * runs direct, no sandbox needed). Pointing `pluginDir` at the whole untrusted
 * plugin instead would run confined under bubblewrap by default.
 *
 *   npx vigiles test examples/harness/oh-my-claudecode-deterministic.harness.mjs
 *   node examples/harness/oh-my-claudecode-deterministic.harness.mjs   # standalone
 *
 * Needs the `claude` CLI (no API key) and a built dist/. External users import
 * from the package: `from "vigiles/harness-test"`.

// (`trace.modelRequests`), so it proves both that the UserPromptSubmit hook fired
// AND that its injected routing LANDED in the model's context. (We assert the
// landing rather than a separate "fired" event because UserPromptSubmit hook-fire
// stream events aren't emitted by every claude version, whereas the landing — the
// thing you actually care about — is observable everywhere.)
