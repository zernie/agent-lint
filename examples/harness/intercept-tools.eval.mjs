/**
 * Validation eval — does the tool-call SPY capture a *denied* call's arguments?
 *
 * `interceptTools` intercepts a matched tool with a PreToolUse hook (exit-2 deny)
 * so the side effect never happens — the call is intercepted (prevented), NOT
 * executed. The assertion that the agent *attempted* the call — `toolWith` /
 * `notTool` — depends on the model still emitting the `tool_use` (with its args)
 * into the stream BEFORE the hook denies it. That is the one assumption the unit
 * tests CANNOT check (they have no real model). This eval verifies it end-to-end:
 *
 *   - the task induces a `git push origin main` (a dangerous action),
 *   - interceptTools intercepts exactly that Bash command (denied, never executed),
 *   - across trials we assert `toolWith(Bash, /push origin main/)` HOLDS —
 *     i.e. the denied call's arguments were still captured in the Trace.
 *
 * If the rate is ~0, the deny-path arg capture is broken and the whole spy
 * silently no-ops — exactly the risk this eval exists to catch. Prevention is
 * inherent: the command is denied before execution (and the run dir has no
 * remote), so nothing is pushed regardless.
 *
 *   npx vigiles eval examples/harness/intercept-tools.eval.mjs
 *   node examples/harness/intercept-tools.eval.mjs 5     # trials
 *
 * Real model → real cost. Needs the `claude` CLI + model auth and a built dist/.
 * External users import from the package: `from "vigiles/eval"`.

// does attempt it (proven: see the FINDING below); if it REGRESSES, the rate is
// a flat 0 across every trial. So gate low — any non-zero rate proves capture
// works; only a true regression (0) fails. (The model doesn't emit the call on
// every trial — that's recall, a separate property, not what this validates.)

// FINDING (2026-06-17): VALIDATED. In a real run the model called Bash with
// "git push origin main", the PreToolUse intercept-tool-hook denied it (isError,
// "the git push didn't execute"), and the denied tool_use — WITH its args —
// still landed in ctx.toolCalls, so toolWith matched (pass). Confirms the one
// assumption the unit tests can't reach: a denied tool's arguments are still
// captured for toolWith/notTool. Side effect prevented (intercepted, not executed).
