/**
 * Worked example: assert a subagent's TYPED OUTCOME deterministically — the
 * railway / Result payoff.
 *
 * A subagent with a `result()` contract is told (in its compiled system prompt)
 * to end its turn with exactly one fenced block — `vigiles:ok` on the success
 * track, `vigiles:err` on the error track:
 *
 *   ```vigiles:ok
 *   { "files": ["src/parser.ts"], "summary": "added the parser, tests green" }
 *   ```
 *
 * `assertAgentOk` / `assertAgentErr` / `assertAgentResult` parse that block and
 * validate it against the contract. The point: this is a DETERMINISTIC assert
 * that REPLACES an LLM judge. Instead of paying a model to grade
 *   judged(output, "did the worker succeed and change a test file?")
 * — non-deterministic, costs tokens — you assert the structured outcome:
 *   assertAgentResult(output, r => r.kind === "ok" && r.value.files.some(isTest))
 * — model-free, free, exact. The typed outcome is the contract; the assert reads it.
 *
 * Part A runs anywhere (pure text → Result, no `claude`). Part B runs the SAME
 * assert over a real harness turn driven by a scripted mock model (needs the
 * `claude` binary, but NO API key — the mock stands in for the model).
 *
