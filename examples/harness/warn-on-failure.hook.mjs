/**
 * A compiled REACT hook — it fires after the tool ran, so it can't block; it
 * emits a `notice(…)` instead. The subject of the react half of
 * `compiled-hook-inprocess.harness.mjs`.
 *
 * Why testing this in-process matters: a notice goes to **stderr**. A probe that
 * shells out and reads stdout sees nothing and concludes the hook is dead, when
 * it is working perfectly. `assertHookNotices` reads the reaction itself.
