/**
 * Side-effect boundary — assert a unit stayed inside its declared write surface
 * DETERMINISTICALLY (no model judge, no API key). Rung 2 of the testability
 * ladder (research/typed-contracts-for-agents.md): a skill that declares it
 * writes only `out.txt` and never pushes is *asserted*, not eyeballed.
 *
 * The check vocabulary is the seam:
 *   - wrote(path)       — it produced the artifact it promised
 *   - didNotWrite(path) — it left nothing OUTSIDE the boundary
 *   - notTool(name, {…})— it never reached for a forbidden side effect (git push)
 *
 * Part A is pure (a hand-built Trace) and ALWAYS runs. Part B drives a real
 * scripted mock turn through `runHarness` — needs the `claude` BINARY but NO
 * key, so it RUNS here and in CI.
