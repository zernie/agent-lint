/**
 * ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL — real side-effect testing against a disposable service (R3).
 *
 * The question promptfoo can't answer cheaply: does my skill ACTUALLY change the
 * world correctly — not "did the model SAY it would," but did the row land in a
 * real Postgres? This spins a throwaway container, lets you drive the skill
 * against it, verifies the REAL resulting state, and tears it down — on your
 * machine, no metered API.
 *
 *   node examples/harness/side-effect-r3.mjs      # needs a running Docker daemon
 *
 * ⚠️ SAFETY — the disposable container is the ONLY isolation. Run this in a
 * disposable environment with NO production access, and keep real credentials
 * (prod DATABASE_URL, cloud keys, ~/.ssh) out of the run. vigiles disposes the
 * container; it does NOT confine the skill. See docs/measuring-skills.md § Safety.
 *
 * The surface is unstable (imported from `vigiles/experimental`); the
 * `measureArms` composition is shown in measure-with-service.mjs.
 * See docs/measuring-skills.md § Experimental and research/r3-disposable-services.md.
