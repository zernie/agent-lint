/**
 * oh-my-claudecode walkthrough — Tier 3: eval (`measureTriggerRate`).
 *
 * The deterministic tier (Tier 2) proves a skill *resolves* when invoked. But
 * whether the REAL model *chooses* a skill from its description — across varied
 * phrasings — is a property only a real model can answer, and the #1
 * skill-authoring pain. This eval installs the real, pinned, vendored OMC plugin
 * natively (`pluginDir`) and measures how reliably its `verify` skill
 * ("Verify that a change really works before you claim completion") fires on
 * prompts that are about exactly that.
 *
 *   npx vigiles eval examples/harness/oh-my-claudecode-eval.eval.mjs
 *   node examples/harness/oh-my-claudecode-eval.eval.mjs 3     # trials per prompt
 *
 * Real model → real cost. This is the ONE tier that needs model auth, so it is
 * NOT run in CI (unlike the unit/deterministic tiers above). External users
 * import from the package: `from "vigiles/eval"`.
