/**
 * Canonical example — a skill *selection-collision* eval (`measureSelectionMatrix`).
 *
 * Per-skill trigger-rate asks each skill in ISOLATION. It can't see the failure
 * that actually breaks a MULTI-skill plugin: one skill hijacking a SIBLING's
 * prompt. `measureSelectionMatrix` installs the whole plugin, runs each skill's
 * own prompts against the entire set, and records WHICH skill fired — an N×N
 * matrix whose diagonal is recall and whose off-diagonal mass is collision.
 * `assertNoCollision` gates it: fail the build when a sibling steals the prompt.
 *
 *   npx vigiles eval examples/harness/skill-selection-collision.eval.mjs
 *
 * Claude-Code-only (it reads which skill the selector chose — Codex has no
 * skill-selection event), so it imports from `vigiles/claude-code`. Prompts are
 * auto-derived from each skill's description here (zero setup); pass your own for
 * a curated benchmark. Real model → real cost; needs `claude` + auth + a built dist/.
