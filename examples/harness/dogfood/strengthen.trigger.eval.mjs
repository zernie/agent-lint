/**
 * Dogfood — does vigiles's OWN `strengthen` skill trigger (and only then)?
 *
 * `strengthen` became model-invocable so the agent reaches for it on its own
 * (upgrade guidance() → enforce()). This eval is the guard that the sharpened
 * description FIRES on "strengthen my rules" requests (recall) and stays QUIET
 * on ordinary linting/coding work (precision) — the precision-aware axis the
 * AWS skill-eval taught us. Pairs with the free load gate in
 * src/adapters/claude-code/skills-dogfood.test.ts.
 *
 *   npx vigiles eval examples/harness/dogfood/strengthen.trigger.eval.mjs
 *
 * Real model → real cost. Needs the `claude` CLI + model auth + a built dist/.
 * Write-don't-run in a keyless env; this is the artifact that runs where a key is.
