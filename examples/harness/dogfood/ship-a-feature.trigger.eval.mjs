/**
 * Dogfood — does the contributor-only `ship-a-feature` skill trigger (and only then)?
 *
 * `ship-a-feature` lives under `.claude/skills/` (this repo's own harness, not
 * the shipped plugin). It must FIRE when someone is about to add a capability /
 * export / public API to vigiles, and stay QUIET on the ordinary edits that
 * surround one — a bug fix, a refactor, a doc tweak, a test. The colocated
 * harness (`.claude/skills/ship-a-feature/ship-a-feature.harness.mjs`) proves
 * the skill's CHECKS fire on their defects; only a real model can prove the
 * DESCRIPTION fires on the right prompt, which is this file.
 *
 *   npx vigiles eval examples/harness/dogfood/ship-a-feature.trigger.eval.mjs
 *
 * Real model → real cost. Needs the `claude` CLI + model auth + a built dist/.
 * Write-don't-run in a keyless env; runs where a key is.
