/**
 * Dogfood — the SCORED check evaluator on vigiles's OWN `strengthen` skill.
 *
 * Exercises the new eval-side checks together: does the skill FIRE
 * (`skill`), is its suggestion actually GOOD (`judged`, model-graded), and is the
 * run CHEAP (`cost`)? `measure` scores each across trials (rate ± se + pass^k);
 * `assertRates` gates them. This is the promptfoo-class scored path, dogfooded.
 *
 *   npx vigiles eval examples/harness/dogfood/skill-quality.eval.mjs
 *
 * Real model → real cost. Needs the `claude` CLI + model auth + a built dist/.
 * Write-don't-run in a keyless env; this is the artifact that runs where a key is.
