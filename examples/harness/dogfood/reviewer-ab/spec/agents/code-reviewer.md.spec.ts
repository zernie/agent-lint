/**
 * A/B arm: the SAME code-reviewer subagent WITH a vigiles spec.
 *
 * Controlled difference vs ../prose/agents/code-reviewer.md: the review
 * instruction is identical, but this adds our TYPED CONTRACT —
 *   - a `result()` outcome (the worker ends with a vigiles:ok/err block, so its
 *     outcome is deterministically parseable: assertAgentOk, no LLM judge), and
 *   - side-effect separation: a tight `tools` allowlist (read-only) + `purity:
 *     "pure"`, so a reviewer cannot write/edit. (No `disallowedTools` — it'd be
 *     redundant under an allowlist; use it only when inheriting all tools.)
 * The A/B eval (../../reviewer-ab.eval.mjs) measures whether that typed contract
 * helps (a parseable outcome) at NO quality cost (still finds the bug).
