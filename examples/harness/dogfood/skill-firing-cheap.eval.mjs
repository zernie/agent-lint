/**
 * Dogfood — the CHEAP firing-only path: `measure` + `stubSkillBodies`.
 *
 * The sibling `skill-quality.eval.mjs` keeps each skill BODY because it grades
 * the suggestion (`judged`) — quality needs the body to run. This eval asks the
 * narrower, far cheaper question: does the `strengthen` skill reliably FIRE on a
 * strengthen request? Firing is a property of the frontmatter (name +
 * description), decided BEFORE the body loads — so `stubSkillBodies: true`
 * replaces each body with a no-op and the run stops AT selection instead of
 * executing the whole multi-step procedure.
 *
 * Measured on this repo's real skill: firing is identical (rate 1 either way),
 * but the stubbed run finished in ~49s vs ~889s full-body — an ~18x saving for
 * the SAME verdict. Stub when you're checking `skill()`/firing; DON'T stub when a
 * `judged`/quality check needs the body (there'd be nothing to grade).
 *
 *   npx vigiles eval examples/harness/dogfood/skill-firing-cheap.eval.mjs
 *
 * Real model → real cost. Needs the `claude` CLI + model auth + a built dist/.
 * Write-don't-run in a keyless env; this is the artifact that runs where a key is.
