/**
 * SessionStart handoff hook — the context-budget lever (dogfood).
 *
 * `.claude/hooks/session-handoff.sh` injects HANDOFF.md as SessionStart
 * `additionalContext` so a new session starts oriented from one ~2k-token
 * pointer file instead of re-reading CLAUDE.md + the research docs. This drives
 * the REAL script through `runHook` (the unit tier — no `claude`, no model) so
 * the injection contract can't silently break: a present HANDOFF.md is emitted
 * as `additionalContext`, an absent one is a clean no-op (fail-open).
 *
 * The hook reads HANDOFF.md from the git toplevel, falling back to `pwd` — so a
 * tmp cwd (no git) exercises the fallback path the way a fresh clone would.
