/**
 * Typed Claude Code authoring surface — the compile-time half of the purity
 * contract, bound to the Claude Code tool vocabulary.
 *
 * The core `experimental_agent()` / `skill()` builders (`vigiles/spec`) are generic over a
 * tool `ToolVocabulary` that DEFAULTS to fully-open (`string` at every purity
 * level), so they accept any tools — backwards-compatible, harness-agnostic.
 * This module re-binds them to the CONCRETE Claude Code vocabulary derived from
 * `claudeCodeDialect`, so authoring a spec with an invalid `purity`×`tools`
 * combination is a `tsc` error at EDIT TIME, before any vigiles command runs:
 *
 *   import { experimental_agent } from "vigiles/claude-code";
 *
 *   experimental_agent({ purity: "pure", tools: ["Read", "Bash"] });
 *   //                                       ^^^^^^ tsc error — Bash side-effecting
 *
 *   experimental_agent({ purity: "bounded", tools: ["Read", "Bash", "Write"] }); // OK
 *   experimental_agent({ purity: "bounded", tools: ["mcp__x__y"] });
 *   //                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^ tsc error — MCP not decidable
 *
 *   experimental_agent({ tools: ["anything", "mcp__x__y"] }); // no purity → open, OK
 *
 * This is a STRICT ADDITION to the runtime/compile checks: `purityViolations`
 * (`vigiles compile`) and `decidePurityGate` (the PreToolUse gate) are unchanged
 * and remain the universal backstop. In particular the command-level decision a
 * `bounded` unit makes for `Bash` (read-only command allowed, mutating denied)
 * is the RUNTIME gate's job — the type only admits the `Bash` TOOL at `bounded`.
 *
 * The CC literal tool names live ONLY in this adapter (and the dialect it reads
 * from), never in core — the hexagonal boundary that keeps the domain
 * harness-agnostic.
