/**
 * vigiles — parse a subagent's railway result.
 *
 * A subagent with a `result()` contract is told (in its compiled system prompt)
 * to end its turn with exactly one fenced block:
 *
 *   ```vigiles:ok
 *   { "files": ["a.ts"], "summary": "done" }
 *   ```
 *
 * or `vigiles:err` for the error track. This module extracts and validates that
 * block — the single primitive the railway orchestrator and the harness-test
 * assertions (`assertAgentOk`/`assertAgentErr`) both build on. Pure and
 * model-free: hand it the worker's text, get back a discriminated outcome.
 *
 * "Railway-oriented" is literal here: the parse is `text -> Result<S, E>` with a
 * third `malformed` track for a worker that didn't honor its contract (no block,
 * bad JSON, or a shape that doesn't match the declared schema).
