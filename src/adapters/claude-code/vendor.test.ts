/**
 * Conformance tests over REAL, vendored plugins (examples/harness/vendor/*).
 *
 * Model-free and in-gate: loadPlugin parses + materializes each plugin's ACTUAL
 * shipped layout, and we assert invariants that must hold for any well-formed
 * plugin — it loads, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves, skills materialize, and the
 * warnings (surface + dangling-ref) are accurate. Grounded in reality rather than
 * synthetic fixtures: this is the shape that caught the superpowers partial-vendor
 * dangling ref. Each plugin is pinned by commit SHA, so the suite is deterministic
 * and offline (no network, no model, no API key).
 *
 * Assertions are INVARIANTS, never version trivia — we check "≥ 1 skill loaded"
 * and "the known dangling ref is flagged, nothing spurious", not "exactly N
 * skills" (which would break on a harmless re-pin and test nothing real).
