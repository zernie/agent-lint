/**
 * Dogfood the user-invoked `skills/adopt-spec` skill. Its procedure is
 * model-driven (no deterministic logic to unit-test), but the skill SHOWS agents
 * an exact `import { … } from "vigiles/spec"` template — and a skill that teaches
 * a symbol the package no longer exports produces specs that don't compile. This
 * is the eat-our-own-dogfood check: every symbol the skill tells an agent to
 * import MUST be a real export of `vigiles/spec`. Catches skill ⇄ API drift and
 * (by naming `skills/adopt-spec`) is the surface's untested-coverage test.
