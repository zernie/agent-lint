/**
 * codexHookProtocol — Codex's hook wire protocol.
 * Finding: it is essentially IDENTICAL to Claude Code's (exit 2 / `decision:block`
 * / `permissionDecision:deny`) — the thin `HookProtocol` port was the right call.
 * The genuine deltas are the env vars a hook receives + the TOML config format
 * (the latter lives in PluginLayout.settingsFormat, not here).
 *
 * Context injection (`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`) is ALSO shared — same
 * shape, confirmed against the official Codex hooks docs
 * (developers.openai.com/codex/hooks): supported on SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit,
 * PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SubagentStart. (Earlier docs called this "deferred" —
 * it is not.) So vigiles's PostToolUse nudges + SessionStart summary deliver on
 * Codex unchanged. Caveats: Stop/SubagentStop/PreCompact carry no context, and
 * Codex marks a hook run failed if it emits an unsupported field for the event.
