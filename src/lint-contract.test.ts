/**
 * The `lint` output contract, from four adopter reports (#181, #182, #183, #185).
 *
 * They arrived as separate issues and share one root: what `lint` REPORTS could
 * not be trusted as a complete, tierable, machine-readable account of the run.
 * Nested bundles were scored by nobody and announced by nobody; two findings fed
 * the exit code with no rule id to address them; the log and the JSON gave
 * different totals with nothing explaining the gap; and getting both artefacts
 * meant scanning the repo twice.
 *
 * 🔴 EVERY CASE HAS BOTH HALVES — it fires on the defect AND stays silent next
 * door. A reporting gate whose success looks like silence cannot be noticed
 * broken.
 *
 * Driven through the REAL built CLI: every one of these is about what the
 * command PRINTS, WRITES or RETURNS, which no unit test of the detectors sees.
