/**
 * A document's own rule about its own commands, made checkable.
 *
 * ## The shape this closes
 *
 * A skill or runbook routinely states a rule in prose and then ships commands
 * that must obey it — "always pass `curl -g`, or bracketed params glob and the
 * request fails SILENTLY"; "every `psql` needs `--single-transaction`". The rule
 * and its violation live **in the same file**, three paragraphs apart, and
 * nothing compares them. It is `prose isn't policy` turned on the author's own
 * document, and it is the smallest possible instance of it.
 *
 * vigiles cannot INFER such a rule — no tool reads "always use -g" and derives
 * which flag is mandatory. What was missing is not cleverness but a cheap way to
 * DECLARE it. Measured 2026-08-11 on a real skill: expressing one rule took ~95
 * lines of hand-rolled markdown parsing (pull fenced blocks, separate a command
 * from prose that talks about a command, parse flags, build the message) around
 * ~5 lines of actual rule. At that price nobody writes the check, and the file
 * keeps its rule as prose — which is exactly the failure the project exists to
 * name.
 *
 * With this the whole test is the rule:
 *
 * ```ts
 * assertChecks(commandsIn(read("SKILL.md"), /curl/), [
 *   mustInclude("-g", "bracketed params glob and the request fails SILENTLY"),
 *   mustInclude("--cacert", "this environment's proxy needs the CA bundle"),
 * ]);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why fenced blocks only
 *
 * The prose that STATES the rule ("always use `curl -g`") contains the command
 * name too. Reading it as a command would make every well-documented rule report
 * itself as a violation — a checker that fires on clean input is muted within a
 * day. So extraction is limited to fenced code blocks, where a line is a command
 * because of where it sits, not because of what it looks like.
 *
 * ## Prior art, and the honest split (surveyed 2026-08-11)
 *
 * The field divides into four quadrants and this sits in the empty one:
 *
 *   extraction              pull blocks out of markdown        codedown, code_extractor
 *   extraction + linter     pull shell, run shellcheck on it   markdown-shellcheck (awk)
 *   execution               RUN the blocks (literate/doctest)  mdsh, Rust doctests, mdbook test
 *   matchers                expect.extend / chai               vitest, jest, jest-dom
 *
 * The nearest neighbour is `markdown-shellcheck`, and the difference is the
 * whole point: it applies a UNIVERSAL correctness checker (quoting, globbing,
 * `$?`) that knows nothing about this document. This applies the rule THIS
 * DOCUMENT STATES ABOUT ITSELF — "in this file every curl carries --cacert" —
 * which no general linter can know and no doctest can express, because the
 * commands here are never run.
 *
 * ⚠️ The EXTRACTION half is not novel and is not claimed to be: `codedown` and
 * `markdown-shellcheck` both do it. It is reimplemented at ~30 dependency-free
 * lines because vendoring an awk script or an npm package for that is worse than
 * owning it. Cheap composition worth stealing from `markdown-shellcheck`: this
 * returns structured commands, so handing them to a real shellcheck when one is
 * installed is a few lines and buys a whole class of checks nobody here should
 * be writing.
 *
 * Pure: takes text, returns data. No filesystem, no shell, nothing is executed.

/**
 * Command lines in `md`'s fenced blocks that match `matching`.
 *
 * Comment lines (`#`) are skipped: a commented-out example is not a command the
 * reader is told to run, and flagging it teaches people to delete their examples.
 *
 * 🔴 THE FILTER IS RE-BUILT WITHOUT `g`/`y`, BECAUSE `RegExp.test` IS STATEFUL.
 * On a global or sticky regex `test()` advances `lastIndex`, so testing a run of
 * matching lines with the SAME object alternates hit/miss. Measured 2026-08-11
 * on four `curl` lines: `/curl/` finds all four, `/curl/g` finds the 1st and the
 * 3rd, `/curl/y` the same. Silent, and the wrong way round — half the document
 * quietly leaves the set that `mustInclude`/`mustNotInclude` then judge, so the
 * rule passes over commands it never saw. `/curl/g` is what a caller writes
 * without thinking, and it must not mean something different.
 *
 * A fresh regex rather than resetting `lastIndex`: the caller's object is theirs
 * and may be reused elsewhere, and there is no state left to reset wrongly. `y`
 * goes too — sticky ANCHORS the match at `lastIndex`, so `/curl/y` against
 * `sudo curl …` would find nothing, which is not what "matching" means here.

/**
 * Every matched command must contain `fragment`.
 *
 * `why` is REQUIRED, and it is the point: the failure message has to carry the
 * consequence, because a bare "missing -g" tells the reader to add a flag
 * without telling them what breaks — and a rule whose reason is lost is the next
 * thing someone deletes as noise. It is usually one clause from the prose the
 * check is enforcing, which keeps the two in the same file and in sync.
 *
 * 🔴 AN EMPTY COMMAND SET PASSES VACUOUSLY, AND THAT IS REPORTED. If the filter
 * matched nothing, the rule held over zero commands — which is true and
 * worthless, and reads identically to a rule that held over twenty. So the check
 * FAILS on an empty set: at that point either the extraction broke or the
 * document stopped shipping the commands the rule is about, and both are things
 * the author wants to hear.
