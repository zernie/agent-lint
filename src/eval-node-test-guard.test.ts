/**
 * The paid tier, under Node's OWN test runner, for real.
 *
 * `core/foreign-runner.test.ts` drives the decision with the process facts as
 * data; `eval.test.ts` proves the composition root calls it — but both of those
 * run under vitest, and vitest is the runner the guard already recognised. The
 * defect this file exists for is precisely the one such a test cannot see: the
 * `node --test` entry in the runner table was `node_modules/.bin/node--test`, a
 * path that does not exist for a runner that is a FLAG on node, so it matched
 * nothing ever. A unit test written from the same wrong belief would have agreed
 * with it. Only starting a real `node --test` and asking what the guard does can
 * tell them apart — so that is what this does.
 *
 * 🔴 SAFETY: the child runs with an EMPTY `PATH`. If the guard ever regresses,
 * `spawnAgent` reaches its `spawn("claude", …)` — and with no PATH there is no
 * `claude` to find, so a regression fails this test instead of billing for it.
 *
 * Deterministic, model-free, offline → the free unit tier. Needs `dist/`
 * (`npm test` / CI build it); skips loudly otherwise, like tool-intercept.test.ts.
