/**
 * The ONE symlink policy for every recursive directory walk in vigiles.
 *
 * 🔴 WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A HELPER INSIDE ONE WALK. Two walks used to
 * cross the same trees — the loader's `readTree` (`plugin-loader.ts`, which builds
 * the file map the whole report is computed from) and the surface enumerator
 * behind the foreign-runner warning (`harnessSurfaceFilesOnDisk`, `scan.ts`).
 * Both used `statSync`, which FOLLOWS a symlink, so a surface dir holding a link
 * to an ancestor was a cycle: measured 2026-08-12 on a two-file fixture, the
 * loader did not merely slow down, it THREW `ELOOP: too many symbolic links
 * encountered` out of `scanPlugin`, and the enumerator reported the same file once
 * per lap. A link to a large external tree is the quieter half: an advisory scan
 * reads a foreign tree into the report.
 *
 * ⚠️ The SECOND walk is gone — the foreign-runner warning and its enumerator were
 * deleted the same day (see the tombstone in `core/foreign-runner.ts`), so the
 * loader is currently the only caller. The policy stays a module rather than
 * folding back into it: the bug it fixes is a property of walking a surface tree,
 * not of one function, and fixing such a pair on only one side is this repo's
 * known failure shape. The next walk over these trees inherits the policy instead
 * of rediscovering ELOOP.

 *
 * 🔴 THE SIZE COMES BACK FROM THE SAME `stat`, and that is not a convenience. The
 * loader needs both "is this a file" and "is it under the size cap", and asking
 * twice produced a SECOND failure path that nothing could reach: between a
 * successful classification and a second `statSync` the file has to vanish, so the
 * `catch` around the size check was dead code that the 100% coverage gate could
 * only ever fail on. One syscall answers both questions and there is no second
 * path to test.
 *
 * `lstat` describes the ENTRY, `stat` describes its target, and both are needed:
 * the first decides whether descending is safe, the second decides what a link
 * actually points at. A symlink to a FILE is still `"file"` — it cannot recurse,
 * it is genuinely part of the tree, and dropping it would lose real findings.
 *
 * A cycle is removed by CONSTRUCTION rather than by a visited-set: there is no
 * bookkeeping to get wrong, and nothing outside the checkout is ever entered. The
 * cost is a deliberate omission — files under a symlinked SUBdirectory are not
 * seen — which for an advisory finding is the correct direction (silence), and for
 * the loader means a linked-in tree is not loaded rather than loaded forty times.
 *
 * Anything unreadable (a dangling link, a permissions error, a socket) is
 * `"skip"`: a walk feeding a read-only report must not die on one bad entry.

/**
 * May a walk DESCEND INTO THIS ROOT — a top-level surface dir such as
 * `.claude/skills`, `skills` or `agents`?
 *
 * 🔴 THE POLICY ABOVE WAS APPLIED TO EVERY ENTRY INSIDE A WALK AND TO NO WALK'S
 * ENTRY POINT. Both walks take their roots straight to `readdirSync`, which
 * FOLLOWS a link, so a symlinked `.claude/skills` was never classified at all —
 * the containment each walk documents ("only the surface dirs are walked, so the
 * rest of the repo and any `node_modules` beside it is never entered"; "a foreign
 * tree is not read into the file map the whole report is computed from") simply
 * did not hold at the top. Same class as the entry-level defect, one level up.
 *
 * ⚠️ A ROOT GETS A DIFFERENT RULE FROM AN INNER ENTRY, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS
 * DELIBERATE — do not "fix" the inconsistency later. An inner symlinked dir is one
 * the walk FOUND BY ITSELF; following it is the walk deciding to leave the tree on
 * its own initiative, so it is refused outright. A surface root is one the LAYOUT
 * NAMES: `.claude/skills` is where a Claude Code repo keeps skills, and linking
 * that at a shared directory (one skills folder used by several checkouts) is an
 * ordinary, supported setup. Refusing it the way an inner entry is refused would
 * report ZERO skills for those repos, silently — a worse failure than the one
 * being fixed, and the exact silent-under-report this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * So a symlinked root IS followed, with one refusal: a target that CONTAINS the
 * scanned root. That is the cycle-and-swallow case — `.claude/skills -> ..`,
 * `skills -> /`, `.claude/skills -> .` — where the walk re-enters the very tree it
 * is scanning through a door the layout did not open, and starts reading
 * `node_modules`, `.git` and every sibling as harness surface.
 *
 * Termination is still by CONSTRUCTION, not by bookkeeping: everything BELOW a
 * followed root goes through {@link entryOf}, which refuses a symlinked dir, so
 * exactly one link hop is taken per root and the hop count for a whole scan is
 * bounded by the number of surface dirs. There is no visited-set to get wrong.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CATCH: a root linked at a huge unrelated
 * external tree (`.claude/skills -> ~/`). Reading it is slow and wide, but the
 * user pointed at it — refusing would be the silent-empty failure above, and
 * "the user asked for a big directory" is not a defect we can tell apart from
 * "the user has a big skills library".
 *
 * A root that is not a symlink at all is `true` unchanged: callers have already
 * established it is a directory, and this must not become a second existence
 * check that quietly disagrees with the first.
