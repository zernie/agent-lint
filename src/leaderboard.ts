/**
 * Plugin health leaderboard — rank many plugins by the deterministic structural
 * signals `scan` already computes (research/divergent-bets.md #9, the engine).
 *
 * This is the no-model half: a defensible health score from concrete facts
 * (missing hook scripts, skills that can't trigger, agents with no tool
 * contract, untested surfaces). It deliberately does NOT score on the loader's
 * free-text warnings — those include doc-mention false positives (see
 * src/scan.ts), and a ranking that penalizes a prose mention would be unfair.
 * The behavioural columns (real trigger-rate, observed egress, safety) need a
 * model and stack on top later; this part runs anywhere in CI for free.
