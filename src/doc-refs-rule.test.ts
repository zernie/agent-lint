/**
 * `doc-refs` — the WIRING, not the engine.
 *
 * `src/core/doc-refs.test.ts` covers `findDocRefs` itself and is untouched by
 * this change. What changed is whether that engine runs at all: the pass used to
 * be unconditional and unturnoffable, and is now the opt-in `doc-refs` rule,
 * default off.
 *
 * Three tiers, driven through the REAL built CLI on a fixture whose one ref is
 * genuinely broken, because the failure being guarded here is a wiring failure
 * (a rule read from the wrong key, a report field still counted when the rule is
 * off) that a library-level call cannot see:
 *
 *   absent  → the section does not print AND the walk does not happen
 *   "warn"  → the finding prints, marked ℹ, and the exit code is untouched
 *   "error" → the finding prints, marked ✗, and lint exits 2
 *
 * The middle case is the one worth a test. A `✗` printed next to an exit code of
 * 0 is how an advisory rule gets mistaken for a gate, which is precisely how this
 * pass came to be worked around with `continue-on-error` in a consumer repo
 * instead of configured.
