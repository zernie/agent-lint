/**
 * EVERY REAL-MODEL SPAWN IS GUARDED — checked over the source, so a future
 * adapter cannot silently skip it.
 *
 * 🔴 WHY A SOURCE CHECK AND NOT THREE MORE CALLS. The guard was believed to sit
 * at "the composition root", where every paid path funnels. Measured 2026-08-12:
 * it funnelled one of four. `measureTriggerRate(spec, { evalDriver })` calls the
 * injected driver's runner DIRECTLY, and `judge` / `deriveAttackReal` are reached
 * from inside a user's `measure` callback — none of them passes the root at all.
 * So "add it in the other three places" is correct today and silently wrong the
 * next time an adapter ships a runner.
 *
 * The trigger GENERALISES instead of listing: any spawn whose program expression
 * mentions `agentBinary` is a model spawn, because that is the field every
 * `HarnessRuntime` declares for its binary — a new adapter spawning
 * `fooRuntime.agentBinary` is caught the day it is written, without this file
 * knowing `foo` exists. The two binaries currently spawned by literal name are
 * covered too.
 *
 * A site passes by CALLING the guard in the same function, or by carrying a
 * free-tier marker with a reason. An unclassified spawn fails: silence is not an
 * option.
