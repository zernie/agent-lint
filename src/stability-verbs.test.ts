/**
 * STABILITY.md's verb list must be the REAL verb list.
 *
 * Reported by an adopter (#176.4): the page promising a stable CLI contract
 * listed `scan`, a verb removed when it became `audit` — so the strongest
 * promise in the repo named a command that answers `Unknown command`. The
 * heaviest kind of doc drift, and the kind that survives longest, because the
 * page is read by people deciding whether to depend on the tool at all.
 *
 * `self-command-refs` could not catch it and still cannot: it is deliberately
 * high-precision and only inspects a `vigiles <cmd>` reference in a COMMAND
 * context, while STABILITY.md names its verbs as a prose list of backticked
 * words. That measured limit is documented; this test closes the one page where
 * the cost of the gap is highest, without widening the detector into the
 * false-positive territory that got `doc-refs` disabled.
