/**
 * `spec-refs` on the surfaces that are NOT `claude` (#190).
 *
 * The rule re-derives a compiled file's references from its spec and validates
 * them the way `compile` does. It used to call `compileClaude` directly and skip
 * every other spec type, so a SKILL.md / subagent / railway artifact committed
 * while its refs were live stayed green forever after the target was deleted:
 * `lint` reported `hash valid` (the artifact DOES match its own header — that is
 * the wrong question) while `compile` reported the broken ref.
 *
 * Measured on this repo when the gap was found: `examples/SKILL.md.spec.ts` named
 * `skills/enforce-rules-format/SKILL.md`, which does not exist, and `lint` was
 * green on it.
 *
 * The fixture reproduces the ORDER that makes it a lint question rather than a
 * compile one — compile while the ref resolves, THEN delete the target. A test
 * that merely wrote a broken spec would be caught by `compile` and prove nothing
 * about `lint`.
