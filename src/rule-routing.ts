/**
 * rule-routing.ts — the deterministic (no-model) State-B routing PREVIEW.
 *
 * `rule-inventory.ts` answers a narrow question ("which prose lines name an
 * off-the-shelf lint rule, and is it enabled?"). This goes one honest step
 * further: it SEGMENTS the whole instruction file into atomic rules
 * ({@link segmentInstructions}) and routes each one into the class that a real
 * enforcement path would take — WITHOUT running a model:
 *
 *   reuse    → the rule text names an off-the-shelf lint rule ({@link INTENT_MAP})
 *              → mechanism: flip one config line. The "narrow list we compile
 *              very well" — everything else is honestly labelled, not force-fit.
 *   hook     → an ACTION rule a linter can't see (git push, rm -rf, "before you
 *              commit") → mechanism: a pre-commit / PreToolUse hook.
 *   meta     → an agent-instruction, not a code rule ("read X first", "tell the
 *              user", "you are …") → mechanism: stays prose. Split out of
 *              `unrouted` so it never reads as "compilable but hard" (it isn't).
 *   semantic → a judgment call ("readable", "single responsibility") no checker
 *              can honestly decide → mechanism: stays prose.
 *   unrouted → looks like a code rule but matched no off-the-shelf rule: HARD to
 *              codify → mechanism `synthesize`: the opt-in SYNTHESIS tier (a
 *              skill on your subscription) MIGHT write a custom checker, gated —
 *              but it is NOT guaranteed (the gate may abstain). This is the
 *              bucket audit must present clearly as "hard", never as done.
 *
 * NB "compile" is NOT used here — `vigiles compile` is the unrelated spec→markdown
 * verb. Synthesis is its own opt-in tier; the mechanism value is `synthesize`.
 *
 * HONESTY BY CONSTRUCTION: the deterministic tier NEVER claims a rule is
 * "synthesizable" — deciding that a custom rule can be written (and gating it)
 * is exactly the work the opt-in model tier does. `unrouted` means "hard — a
 * synthesis skill may try", never a promise; `meta`/`semantic` mean "not an
 * enforceable code rule at all" (a different, honest kind of no).
 *
 * Pure, deterministic, dependency-free. Reuses `rule-inventory`'s hardened
 * whole-token matcher + `INTENT_MAP`, and `segment`'s Tier-A segmenter.
