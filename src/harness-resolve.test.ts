/**
 * A harness resolves its bare `vigiles` import from the CLI's own install (#184).
 *
 * The report: a harness does `import { runHook } from "vigiles"`, so the package
 * must sit in a `node_modules` Node can reach. In a repo that already has a
 * `package.json`, the obvious way to put it there installs the WHOLE dependency
 * tree — measured at 840 packages in 2 minutes where vigiles alone is 42, with
 * one run sitting 11 minutes in that step before being cancelled. The reporter's
 * workaround was installing to a directory outside the workspace and symlinking
 * the tree back in.
 *
 * ⚠️ `NODE_PATH` is NOT the fix, and that was measured rather than assumed: Node
 * ignores it for ESM resolution and a harness is ESM. A resolver hook is the only
 * mechanism left short of a real `node_modules` entry.
