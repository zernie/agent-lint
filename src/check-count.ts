/**
 * vigiles — the CHECK COUNTER: the channel a `*.harness.*` / `*.eval.*` script
 * uses to tell `vigiles test` / `vigiles eval` how much it actually did.
 *
 * 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. The runner knew exit codes and nothing else, so a script
 * that ran NOTHING was indistinguishable from one that ran and passed. Measured
 * 2026-08-08 — a file whose entire content is
 *
 *     export default { "never runs": () => assert.equal(1, 2) };
 *
 * imports cleanly, exits 0, and the runner printed `✓ … 1 passed`. The assertion
 * inside it is false; it is never called, because nothing calls an exported
 * object. Not hypothetical: a consumer repo hit it, and now hand-copies a warning
 * into the header of every new harness file — "An earlier version exported a
 * `tests` object; nothing ran and the runner printed ✓" — because the runner
 * could not enforce it. Eight harnesses resting on a comment.
 *
 * This is the same distinction `assertNoWrite` already draws between `undefined`
 * and `[]`: "nobody looked" and "nothing happened" must not print the same.
 *
 * HOW IT REPORTS. `vigiles test` puts a scratch path in `VIGILES_CHECK_COUNT_FILE`
 * before spawning each script; on exit, a script that loaded this module writes
 * its count there. A FILE, not stdout, because the runner inherits stdio so the
 * script's own report streams live — there is no stream left to parse. Not an
 * exit code either: those already carry pass/skip/fail, and overloading one would
 * make a real failure ambiguous.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A CHECK: an observation vigiles can see the script make — a run
 * through one of the tiers (`runHook`, `runHarnessTest`, `runEval`, …), an
 * in-process compiled-hook decision asserted, or an explicit {@link recordCheck}
 * from a harness that asserts some other way (`node:assert`, a runner's
 * `expect`). Deliberately generous: the question this answers is "did this file
 * exercise the harness at all", and a false "0 checks" against a script that
 * genuinely tested something would be exactly the crying wolf the rest of the
 * tool avoids.
 *
 * WHAT A MISSING COUNT MEANS: nothing at all. A script that never imports
 * `vigiles` cannot report, so the runner sees no file and treats it
 * exactly as before — a plain pass. Silence is the legacy branch, never a
 * verdict; only a count of literally zero is a finding. (The alternative —
 * force-loading this module into every child with `node --import` so silence
 * became impossible — was rejected: it would report `0` for a hand-rolled
 * harness that spawns and asserts entirely on its own, which is a real and
 * blameless way to write one.)
 *
 * ## 2026-08-11 — the channel also carries WHAT was exercised
 *
 * 🔴 THE DEFECT. Coverage answered "is surface X tested?" from a FILE NAME —
 * colocation. Measured on a real repo, `.claude/skills/paper-pipeline/` held six
 * `*.eval.mjs`, exactly one of them about that skill, and the orchestrator scored
 * as covered with no test of its own; an EMPTY `foo.eval.mjs` counts just the
 * same. Every mature ecosystem (`go test -cover`, coverage.py, nyc, tarpaulin)
 * answers that question from EXECUTION and uses the name only to find the file.
 *
 * So the tiers now also record WHICH SURFACE a run went by — a {@link SurfaceProbe}
 * — and this channel carries it out alongside the count. Two properties matter:
 *
 * - **Derived, never declared.** The probe comes from what the tier already knew
 *   it was pointed at: the command string `runScript`/`runHook` executed, the
 *   Skill/hook events in a run's transcript. A field an AUTHOR fills in would be
 *   the retired `vigiles:covers` marker with extra steps — a claim about a test,
 *   made by the person who wrote the test.
 * - **A probe is a REFERENCE, not a verdict.** Resolving `hooks/pre-edit.sh` or
 *   `plugin:argument-arc` to a repo surface needs discovery, which this module
 *   has no business doing inside a user's test process. The runner resolves it
 *   (`coverage-artifact.ts`); anything unresolvable is dropped, never guessed.
 *
 * WIRE FORMAT, and why it is two shapes. A run with no probes writes the bare
 * number it always wrote, byte for byte; only a run with something to say writes
 * JSON (`{"checks":N,"surfaces":[…]}`). Readers accept both — an older runner
 * meeting the JSON form reads "no report", i.e. the legacy branch, which is a
 * plain pass rather than a wrong verdict. Silence stays silence.
