/**
 * Runtime-owned named state, END TO END against the real CLI.
 *
 * The pure model is tested in `core/hook-state.test.ts`. Everything asserted HERE
 * lives in the trusted runtime and cannot be seen from a unit test: where the
 * store lands on disk, that a key can never address a path, that one hook's
 * record is what a DIFFERENT hook reads back, and that the write happens through
 * the runtime rather than through anything the hook can reach.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole reason this file exists. The predicates could all
 * be green while the runtime wrote to the wrong directory, or wrote nothing, and
 * an advisory hook whose success looks like silence would never tell anyone.
