/**
 * The audit VERDICT engine — a header sentence + per-recommendation `pointsIfFixed`,
 * both derived by RE-SCORING, never by a hardcoded template with a fake number.
 *
 * The audit scorer ({@link auditScore}) is pure and deterministic: `overall` is
 * `100 − Σ(graded penalties)` (clamped to [0,100]) and the letter grade comes from
 * fixed thresholds (A ≥90 … F <60). Because it's pure, we can answer two "what if"
 * questions by RUNNING it again with a single recommendation's finding(s) removed
 * and diffing the `overall`:
 *
 *   1. `pointsIfFixed` per recommendation — the exact number of overall points the
 *      grade gains if THAT one fix is applied (so a fix card can show `+N pts` and
 *      sort by it). Computed as `overall(report − thisFinding) − overall(report)`.
 *   2. A verdict `sentence` for the report header — e.g. "Two fixes away
 *      from an A." — where the COUNT is the minimal number of fixes whose COMBINED
 *      removal actually crosses the next grade threshold (a real cumulative
 *      re-score), and `pointsToNextGrade` is the real threshold gap.
 *
 * Every recommendation maps 1:1 to exactly one graded finding (see `optimize` /
 * `explainScore`): each is a single deduction of a known weight, so removing it
 * lowers the penalty by that weight (modulo the [0,100] clamp). We remove the
 * finding by its detector + content (matched against the given recommendation),
 * NOT by reproducing `explainScore`'s ordering — so this stays aligned with the
 * `recommendations` array the caller passes, by index.
 *
 * Pure over its inputs (the same pieces `buildAuditReport` already has): no fs, no
 * clock, no model, no mutation of the caller's report.
 *
 * LIMITATION (documented, not fabricated): some graded penalties have NO
 * corresponding recommendation (a hard lethal-trifecta contract, an MCP server
 * that can't start, a `disallowedTools` typo, an invalid model/color, unresolved
 * skill resources, an invisible skill, a misplaced plugin dir, an ineffective /
 * never-firing hook). Those cannot be "fixed" through a recommendation here, so
 * they never contribute to `pointsIfFixed` and can make `fixesToNextGrade` null
 * (the gap can't be closed by the deterministic fix list alone) — in which case
 * the verdict leads with the dominant blocking finding instead. The
 * fixes-to-next-grade count uses a greedy largest-delta-first ordering; that is
 * provably minimal when penalties are additive (the common case, away from the
 * score-0 clamp) and a close upper bound otherwise.
