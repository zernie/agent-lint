/**
 * `compile` must not mint a hash-valid artifact over refs it just called dead
 * (#173) — driven through the REAL built CLI, because the defect is in what the
 * command LEAVES ON DISK, which no unit test of `compileClaude` can observe.
 *
 * The reported repro, verbatim in shape: a spec naming a file and an npm script
 * that do not exist. `compile` printed both errors and exited 1 — and still
 * wrote `CLAUDE.md`, stamped with a valid integrity hash. `lint` verifies that
 * hash, finds it intact, and exits 0. So the command the README calls the CI
 * gate for broken refs went green over breakage that had been printed minutes
 * earlier on the author's own screen.
 *
 * Deterministic, model-free, offline → the free unit tier.
