/**
 * ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL — the EMIT delivery for a typed result: the skill CALLS a tool
 * carrying its outcome instead of ENDING its turn with a fenced block.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A typed `output` (an `OutputContract`) is valid only on a forked skill: compile
 * hard-errors `output-without-fork` on the other 31, because an inline skill is
 * spliced into the conversation, has no call→return boundary, and therefore has
 * no return value to type (`research/spec-syntax-and-railway-scope.md`).
 *
 * A TOOL CALL needs no return boundary. The skill does not return the structure —
 * it EMITS it, mid-conversation, and the call lands in `Trace.toolCalls`. So the
 * objection that grounds the exclusion does not apply to this delivery. Same
 * `OutputContract`; a different way of getting it out.
 *
 * ## What is UNPROVEN (why the `experimental_` prefix is on every runtime export)
 *
 *  1. **N=8, one skill, one model.** Measured 2026-08-13 against `paper-status`
 *     (unforked; `allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Grep, Glob`) on sonnet: 8 runs, 8
 *     emits, all on the `ok` track, all parsing against the contract, none
 *     repeated. That answers "does it land at all" and nothing about the rate —
 *     8 of 8 bounds the true failure rate at about 31%, which is not evidence of
 *     reliability. Raw arguments + the free re-scorer:
 *     `examples/experimental-emit/`.
 *  2. **Nobody depends on it.** Neither `compileSkill` nor `compileAgent` emits
 *     this instruction; the caller pastes `.instruction` into a skill body and
 *     serves `.tool` from their own MCP server by hand. There is no compile-time
 *     path, so no skill in any corpus is typed by it yet.
 *  3. **The transport is not part of the contract.** MCP is how the tool reached
 *     the model in the measurement. Whether a plugin can hand the model a tool
 *     WITHOUT a separate server process is untested, and the answer changes what
 *     this surface should look like.
 *  4. **The runtime does not enforce `required`.** Measured: Claude Code accepted a
 *     call omitting three declared-required fields (raw proof in `mine`,
 *     `vigiles/repro/output-contract-2026-08-13/mcp-arm/schema-probe-emitted.jsonl`).
 *     `inputSchema` is DESCRIPTION for the model, not a runtime gate — which is
 *     exactly why `experimental_parseEmitted` re-validates on the receiving side
 *     and why "the API validates it for you" must not be claimed.
 *
 * ## What would have to be true to drop the prefix
 *
 *  - A rate, not an existence proof: ≥30 trials across ≥2 unforked skills and ≥2
 *    models, with the emit-landing rate reported and its failure modes named.
 *  - One consumer inside vigiles that compiles the instruction from the spec, so
 *    the tool name and the shape cannot drift apart by hand.
 *  - A measured answer to (3) — plugin-served tool vs external MCP server — since
 *    an in-process tool would remove the standing-up cost this surface assumes.
 *
 * Until then: not covered by the stability guarantee, may change or be removed
 * without a major bump. See `docs/../STABILITY.md` and `src/experimental.ts`.
