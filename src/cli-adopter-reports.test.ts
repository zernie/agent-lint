/**
 * Four small CLI defects reported by an adopter (#176, #175) — each one a place
 * the CLI was quietly wrong rather than loudly broken, which is why they all
 * survived to be found by hand in someone else's repo.
 *
 * Driven through the REAL built CLI: every one of these is about what the
 * command PRINTS, RETURNS, or WRITES, none of which a unit test of the
 * underlying function can see.
 *
 * Deterministic, model-free, offline → the free unit tier.
