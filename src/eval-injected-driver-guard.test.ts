/**
 * THE INJECTED-DRIVER PATH, under a real foreign runner.
 *
 * 🔴 The refusal guarded the DEFAULT runner and nothing else. `measureTriggerRate(
 * spec, { evalDriver: codexEvalDriver })` — the publicly documented alternative,
 * and the one the untested-skill nudge now tells Codex users to pass — calls the
 * injected driver's runner directly, which ends in `spawnSync("codex", …)`. So a
 * stray `npx vitest run` that collected a Codex eval spent real money on every
 * push while the guard looked complete. `judge` is the same story reached from
 * inside a user's `measure` callback.
 *
 * Driven through a REAL `node --test` child, for the reason `eval-node-test-guard.
 * test.ts` gives: this suite runs under vitest, so a test asserting "vitest is
 * refused" agrees with whatever the guard already believes. Only starting an
 * actual foreign runner can tell a working guard from a believed one.
 *
 * 🔴 SAFETY: the child runs with an EMPTY `PATH`. If a guard regresses, the spawn
 * is reached — and with no PATH there is no `codex`/`claude` to find, so the
 * regression fails this test instead of billing for it.
 *
 * Needs `dist/`; skips loudly otherwise.
