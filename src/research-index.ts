 * already verifies the OTHER direction (every indexed path EXISTS, else
 * `vigiles compile` fails), so the only open gap is a doc that was ADDED but
 * never indexed. This check closes it: every `research/*.md` (except the
 * human-facing `README.md`) must appear in the index, or the dogfood test fails.
 *
 * Pure — the caller supplies the doc filenames and the index content (the spec
 * source, where an entry is AUTHORED), so it runs over the real `research/` dir
 * in a test or over any file set. Bidirectional sync = compiler (index ⊆ docs)
 * + this check (docs ⊆ index).
