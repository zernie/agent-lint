/**
 * The shared symlink policy for recursive walks: `entryOf` for every entry INSIDE
 * a walk, `walkableRoot` for the walk's entry point.
 *
 * Both halves per shape: a symlinked DIRECTORY is refused (the cycle/escape case),
 * and everything else classifies exactly as a plain `statSync` walk would — a fix
 * that simply returned `"skip"` for everything would pass the first assertion
 * alone and silently empty every report built on these walks. The root half has
 * the same shape with the OPPOSITE default, and for a stated reason: a linked-in
 * shared skills dir is a real layout, so refusing every symlinked root would empty
 * the surface list for those repos — see `walkableRoot`.
