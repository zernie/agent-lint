/**
 * A skill that names a SIBLING SKILL that does not exist.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * `danglingRefs` (plugin-loader.ts) already reports broken intra-plugin
 * references — but it matches PATHS (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/x.sh`) in
 * EXECUTABLE sources, and it skips prose by design (`DOC_SOURCE_RE` → skip). A
 * skill referring to another skill BY NAME, in prose, was checked by nothing.
 *
 * That is the reference agents actually follow. Skills route to each other
 * constantly — "run `verify-citations` first", "compose with `find-venue`" — and
 * a rename breaks every mention SILENTLY. Nothing crashes: the model reads a
 * route to a skill that is not there and does something adjacent, which is the
 * failure mode this whole tool exists for. Found 2026-08-11 in a consumer repo
 * whose orchestrator skill listed the pipeline's stages by name; two stages had
 * been added and never listed, and one local hand-written harness was the only
 * thing that noticed.
 *
 * ## Precision first, and why it is a NEAR-MISS check rather than a name check
 *
 * The naive version — "every backticked kebab token must be a skill" — fires on
 * `claude-code`, `node-fetch`, `pull-request`, every hyphenated noun an author
 * writes. A checker that fires on clean input is muted within a day, which is
 * worse than one that misses, so this asks a narrower question:
 *
 *   is this token ALMOST a skill that exists?
 *
 * A kebab token within a small edit distance of a real skill name, that is not
 * itself a real skill, is a rename or a typo with high probability — while
 * `node-fetch` in a repo of paper skills is far from all of them and stays
 * silent. The check is deliberately blind to a reference to a skill that never
 * existed under any similar name; that case is indistinguishable from ordinary
 * hyphenated prose without reading intent.
 *
 * Pure: takes names and contents, touches no filesystem, so the disk walker and
 * any in-browser twin can share it.
