/**
 * Verdict-engine suite (vitest, no fs/model): pure over a hand-built ScanReport.
 * The verdict sentence + per-recommendation `pointsIfFixed` are derived by
 * RE-SCORING (auditScore run again with a finding removed) and diffing the
 * overall — never a hardcoded number. We feed the REAL `auditScore` + `optimize`
 * outputs in (the same pieces buildAuditReport holds) so the detector→finding
 * mapping is exercised end-to-end, not mocked.
