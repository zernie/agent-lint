/**
 * Every relative import in a runnable example must RESOLVE.
 *
 * 🔴 WRITTEN AFTER A REVIEWER FOUND WHAT MY GREPS COULD NOT (2026-08-21). Deleting
 * `src/experimental.ts` left `examples/harness/side-effect-r3.mjs` and
 * `measure-with-service.mjs` importing `../../dist/experimental.js` — a file the
 * build no longer emits. Both would die on `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` before reaching
 * even their Docker availability check. I had swept the tree for the string
 * `vigiles/experimental`, and a relative path into `dist/` is not that string.
 *
 * This is the SAME class this project has already written down once: after a
 * directory move, a literal path, path segments joined at runtime, a relative
 * import, and a path built inside a regex were four different spellings of one
 * reference, and searching for the first found only the first. A relative `dist/`
 * import is a fifth spelling. The prescribed fix was never "grep more carefully"
 * — it was "resolve every relative import and require the target to exist",
 * which is what this file does.
 *
 * WHY THE EXAMPLES SPECIFICALLY. They are the one body of code here that nothing
 * else checks: `.mjs`, so `tsc` never sees them; outside `src/`, so `npm run lint`
 * never sees them; not imported by any test, so a broken one fails only when a
 * reader runs it — which is to say, in front of the person we were trying to
 * convince. `node --check` would not catch it either: the syntax is fine, the
 * file just is not there.
 *
 * WHY A TEST AND NOT A CI STAGE. It costs milliseconds inside a job that already
 * runs, versus a new job paying setup + checkout + install for the same answer.
 * This repo's CI budget rule is explicit about that trade.
 *
 * VERIFIED BY MUTATION, both halves and both directions (2026-08-21), each with
 * a grep proving the patch actually landed before the run:
 *   1. point `side-effect-r3.mjs` back at the deleted `dist/experimental.js`
 *      (the reviewer's exact finding)          → fails, naming the file and the
 *                                                 two paths it looked for;
 *   2. the same, but with a stale `dist/experimental.js` TOUCHED ONTO DISK first
 *      → still fails. That is the whole point of judging by source: this is the
 *        run that would have gone green under the obvious implementation.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated so the silence is readable: relative specifiers only. A bare
 * specifier (`vitest`, `node:fs`) is a dependency question and belongs to the
 * package manager, not here. Dynamic `import()` with a computed path cannot be
 * resolved statically and is not attempted.

      // checkout, which is the worst place to learn it.
