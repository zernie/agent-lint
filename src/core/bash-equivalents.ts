/**
 * Shell-EQUIVALENT rewrites of a dangerous command — the generator behind the
 * metamorphic disaster battery.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `DISASTER_CATALOG` is seven commands a human labelled
 * dangerous, written one way each. Measured 2026-09-02: the compiled guard behind
 * the published "2/7 → 7/7" headline blocked all seven seeds and only 8 of 30
 * shell-equivalent rewrites of them — `git push "--force" origin main` (a quoted
 * flag), `sudo git push --force`, `/usr/bin/git push --force`. The number was
 * true and it was measured on the only forms anyone had written down.
 *
 * WHY A GENERATOR AND NOT MORE HAND-WRITTEN ROWS. Adding rows by hand closes the
 * forms you thought of, which is the same bounded set that produced the gap. The
 * escape space is not enumerable by memory.
 *
 * WHY THIS NEEDS NO ORACLE — the part that makes it sound rather than clever.
 * Generating a NEW dangerous command would need a human to label it. This
 * generates only REWRITES of an already-labelled one, so:
 *
 *   dangerous  ← inherited from the seed a human labelled
 *   same thing ← decided by `leafCommandsNormalized`, our own normalizer
 *
 * Neither half is a new judgement. This is metamorphic testing (Chen et al.,
 * 1998): with no oracle for a fresh input, assert instead that a
 * semantics-preserving transform does not change the verdict.
 *
 * WHERE IT STOPS, and why the boundary is not a policy choice. The transform
 * families are exactly the ones the normalizer collapses. `eval`, `sh -c`, a
 * `$VAR` head, base64 — the normalizer returns null for those, so a variant
 * built from them CANNOT pass the self-check and is never emitted. That is the
 * correct boundary: a guard built on `runs()` genuinely cannot see through
 * `eval "$(echo … | base64 -d)"`, so emitting it would call a correct guard
 * broken — the crying-wolf failure that gets a check switched off.
