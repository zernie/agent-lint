/**
 * vigiles — SKILL.md missing-fence detector (the cross-reference moat applied
 * to SKILL.md frontmatter structure).
 *
 * A SKILL.md that begins with frontmatter-looking keys (`name:`, `description:`,
 * `allowed-tools:`, etc.) but is MISSING the opening `---` fence is a very
 * common real-world pain: the harness loads the whole file as plain body text —
 * no name, no description, no tool list — so the skill is INVISIBLE and never
 * fires. The model-selector has nothing to match against and the agent can never
 * find the skill at all.
 *
 * HIGH-PRECISION / FP-SAFE, by the same don't-cry-wolf discipline as the rest of
 * vigiles (see `danglingRefs`, `confidentToolIssues`): we flag ONLY when the
 * first non-blank, non-comment line matches a KNOWN frontmatter key at column 0
 * from an explicit whitelist (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`, `tools`,
 * `model`, `color`, `disable-model-invocation`, `argument-hint`, `version`,
 * `license`, `metadata`). A random prose line like `Note: something` is never
 * flagged — the whitelist is what keeps the check FP-safe. Prefer MISSING a
 * real finding over emitting a false positive.
 *
 * Pure: no IO. Input is the raw SKILL.md content string.
