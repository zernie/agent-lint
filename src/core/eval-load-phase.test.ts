// A gate wired into three of four spawn doors reads as complete and is not.
// That is not hypothetical here: `refuseUnderForeignRunner` shipped guarding
// ONE door of four, and the other three billed for it. This asserts the wiring
// by reading the sources, so a fifth door added without the call fails a test.
//
// 🔴 IT PARSES, IT DOES NOT GREP — and that distinction was found by mutation,
// not by review. The first version of this block asserted
// `src.includes('refuseDuringEvalLoad("grading with `claude`")')`. Commenting
// the call out left the substring in the file, so the mutation ran GREEN: the
// check could not tell a live call from a comment about one. A CallExpression
// in the syntax tree cannot be a comment.
