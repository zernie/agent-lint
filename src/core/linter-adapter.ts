/**
 * vigiles — the LinterAdapter port.
 *
 * A "linter" was smeared across parallel registries (existence checks, config
 * checkers, a tool map, a suggestion enumerator, generate-types discoverers)
 * with nothing enforcing completeness — so adding one meant editing ~7 sites in
 * lockstep, and a missed site failed silently. This port makes a linter ONE
 * cohesive, type-enforced unit: the concrete `LINTERS` registry (in
 * `linters.ts`) is a `Record<BuiltinLinter, LinterAdapter>`, so a missing linter
 * or capability is a tsc error, and `linter-contract.test.ts` covers the
 * docs/prose parity a type can't see. Mirrors the `HarnessAdapter`/`rule-meta`
 * patterns already used in the repo. See `research/linter-adapter-architecture.md`.
 *
 * This module is a TYPE-ONLY LEAF: it imports only a type from `spec.ts` (the
 * zero-import authoring surface), and owns the two shared domain types
 * (`ConfigEnabledStatus`, `DiscoveredRules`) so `linters.ts` and
 * `generate-types.ts` both depend on it without a cycle.
