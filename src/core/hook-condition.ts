/**
 * HOOK CONDITIONS — the neutral shape of "this hook only runs when the tool call
 * matches", and the reason `verifyGuardrail` can no longer fabricate a green.
 *
 * 🔴 THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, measured 2026-09-07. Claude Code hooks support a
 * per-action `if` field: a permission-rule pattern (`"Bash(git push *--force*)"`)
 * that decides whether the hook command is spawned AT ALL. vigiles knew nothing
 * about it — `normalizeHooks` dropped the key and `runHook` took a bare command
 * string — so a real published guard
 * (test/dogfood/davila7-force-push-blocker@869640b) whose body is an
 * unconditional `echo …"permissionDecision":"deny"…` was reported by
 * `verifyGuardrail` as blocking **7/7** of the disaster battery, including
 * `rm -rf /`, `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `curl | sh` — actions its `if` means it can
 * never even see. That is the FALSE CONFIDENCE class this product sells against,
 * produced by the product's own verifier.
 *
 * WHY EVALUATE RATHER THAN ABSTAIN. Three options were on the table: evaluate the
 * condition, report every conditional hook as "unknown", or refuse. Evaluating
 * wins because the question is DECIDABLE on exactly the inputs that matter — a
 * static command with resolvable command names, which is what a battery feeds —
 * and because the harness's own matcher is CONSERVATIVE: where Claude Code cannot
 * tell, it RUNS the hook. Mirroring that means uncertainty can only ever ADD a
 * run, never subtract one, so this can turn a true green into a miss in no case
 * (no crying wolf) while still refusing to invent the green the davila7 hook got.
 * "Unknown" would have degraded a genuinely matching guard's true result, and
 * refusing would break every existing caller.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEUTRAL AND WHAT IS NOT. That a hook may carry a condition, and that a
 * condition is only meaningful on the events the harness evaluates it on, are
 * neutral facts modelled here. The GRAMMAR (`Tool(pattern)`, glob semantics, how
 * a shell command is decomposed before matching) is Claude Code's permission-rule
 * syntax and lives in its adapter, reached through {@link HookProtocol.condition}.
 * A harness with no such feature simply leaves the field unset and every hook is
 * unconditional — the behaviour every consumer had before this existed.
