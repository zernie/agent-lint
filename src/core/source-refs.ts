/**
 * vigiles — recovering a FILE REFERENCE from PLAIN SOURCE TEXT.
 *
 * The third of three reference grammars, and the only one with no parser behind
 * it. A markdown body is read by markdown-it (`core/markdown.ts` →
 * `markdownRefs`), a hook `command` is read by mvdan-sh (`core/bash-effects.ts`
 * → `commandWords`), and what is left — the body of a hook script, a helper
 * `.js` / `.py` / `.rb` — is scanned for path-shaped character runs, because a
 * general-purpose "find every path this program touches" analysis is not a
 * thing this tool can be.
 *
 * Since that scan IS a character run, the only thing standing between it and a
 * false accusation is where the run may START and STOP. This module owns both
 * boundaries and the extension vocabularies, so no caller can build a pattern
 * without them.
 *
 * ## The two boundaries, and the two live defects that came from omitting them
 *
 * RIGHT — the extension must END the token. `INTRA_REF_EXTS` used to be a bare
 * alternation with no trailing assertion, and `js` sits ahead of `json` in it,
 * so `hooks/hooks.json` matched as `hooks/hooks.js`. Measured 2026-08-17 on
 * `microsoft/power-platform-skills`: a `//` comment naming `hooks/hooks.json`,
 * with that exact file sitting beside it on disk, was reported as
 * "hooks/hooks.js (referenced but MISSING)" — a maintainer told a file they
 * have is missing, under a name they never wrote.
 *
 * LEFT — the surface dir must START the token. `(?:agents|hooks|skills)/` with
 * nothing before it also matches the tail of `claude-agents/`. Measured the
 * same day on `fcakyon/claude-codex-settings`: a
 * `new URL("../../../claude-agents/fable-advisor.md", …)` — a correct,
 * resolving reference — was reported as a broken `agents/fable-advisor.md`.
 * That boundary is a predicate ({@link startsAtSeparator}) rather than a regex
 * lookbehind, because the browser twin (`scan-files.ts`) compiles this into the
 * demo engine, and because the caller already inspects `m.index` for its
 * plugin-rooted test.
 *
 * ## Comments are prose in every language, not only in shell
 *
 * `stripShellComments` had the right idea and too narrow a domain: a full-line
 * `#` in a `.sh` file is prose, and so is a full-line `//` or a JSDoc `*` in a
 * `.js` file. Both remaining corpus false accusations in this detector came out
 * of JSDoc — `* It is deliberately not registered in hooks/hooks.json:` and
 * "`git log --grep=.env -- hooks/x.mjs` is refused …". Neither is a file
 * operation; both were reported as broken references.
 *
 * FULL-LINE ONLY, the same rule the shell version already held. A trailing
 * comment on a real code line is left alone, so a genuine reference sharing a
 * line with code is never dropped. The cost is stated rather than hidden: a
 * path mentioned ONLY in a trailing comment still counts as a reference.

/**
 * The right boundary: the matched extension must be the END of the token.
 * A negative lookahead over the characters an extension is drawn from, so `js`
 * cannot claim the head of `json` / `jsonl` and `py` cannot claim `pyc`. `.` is
 * deliberately NOT in the class, which preserves the prior `\b` behaviour on
 * `bundle.js.map`.
