/**
 * Dogfood — vigiles's OWN plugin conforms to the Agent Plugins standard.
 *
 * vigiles ships as a plugin, so it holds itself to the vendor-neutral packaging
 * standard it tells other people to verify: a root `plugin.json` per Agent
 * Plugins 1.0.0, with `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` where the spec says to look.
 *
 * Two manifests now describe the same plugin — the neutral root `plugin.json`
 * (Agent Plugins) and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (Claude Code's own format,
 * which carries the `hooks` block the 1.0.0 spec has no home for). Two hand-kept
 * files DRIFT: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` was already a major version
 * behind `plugin.json` when this test was written. So the drift is a CI failure,
 * not a discipline problem — the same reflex as the integrity hash.
 *
 * Model-free, offline, no network: the schema's RULES are asserted here rather
 * than fetched, so the gate runs on every commit. Bumping the pinned spec
 * version is therefore a deliberate edit to this file.
