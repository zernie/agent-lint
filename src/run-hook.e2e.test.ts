/**
 * e2e tier — allowlisted REAL egress (`egress: { allow }`).
 *
 * These need a routable rootless sandbox (bwrap + slirp4netns/pasta + nft) AND
 * real outbound network. The import path no longer says so: the barrels split on
 * COST, not on capability, so `runHook` and `egressRoutes` both come from the
 * free root surface ([`vigiles`](./test.ts), here the in-repo `./test.js`
 * barrel). What routes this file to the expensive tier is its `.e2e.test.ts`
 * NAME, read by the vitest `e2e` project. Gated by `egressRoutes()` so they run for
 * real where egress actually routes and skip honestly where it can't (e.g. a
 * GitHub-hosted runner whose slirp4netns never attaches `tap0`) instead of
 * failing red — see research/egress-sandbox-tooling.md (pasta is the fix that
 * makes them run in CI too).
