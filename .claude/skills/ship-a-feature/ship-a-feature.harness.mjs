/**
 * ship-a-feature — colocated harness, run by `vigiles test` (free tier).
 *
 *   npx vigiles test .claude/skills/ship-a-feature/ship-a-feature.harness.mjs
 *
 * NAMED AFTER THE SKILL AND IN ITS OWN DIRECTORY on purpose: vigiles credits
 * coverage by placement (`isColocatedTest` — `<name>.harness.*` beside the
 * SKILL.md), not by a test that merely mentions the surface.
 *
 * What it proves, in three tiers:
 *
 *   A. The skill's OWN executable checks FIRE on each defect they were written
 *      for and stay QUIET on a clean case — driven over throwaway git fixtures
 *      through `runScript` (the public primitive), one fixture per measured
 *      failure. A check that has never been seen firing is indistinguishable
 *      from a dead one.
 *   B. The SKILL.md is loadable as a model-invocable skill and its body still
 *      points at the script (deleting the command turns this back into prose).
 *   C. (needs `claude`; skips LOUDLY otherwise) the skill, loaded the way it
 *      ships, ACTIVATES and its body reaches the model — a scripted mock, $0.
 *
 * What it does NOT prove: that the description fires on a real "add a feature"
 * prompt and stays quiet on a bug fix. That needs a real model —
 * `examples/harness/dogfood/ship-a-feature.trigger.eval.mjs`.
